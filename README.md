# Altera_FPGA_Projects  

This repository contains demo projects for those who are interested in getting started with FPGA development.  
The EP4CE6E22C8N FPGA board is a major requirement for running and testing the projects in this repo. Most of the designs in this repo were developed from scratch, therefore they aren't necessarily the most optimal implementations. This makes it a good learning experience for whoever is interested in this project to optimize parts of the designs in their own copies of the repository. I try to keep resource utilization (logic elements and registers) to a reasonable level and ensure a maximum operating frequency (Fmax) of at least 100 MHz. All the projects in this repository strictly follow the Synchronous Design Methodology.
