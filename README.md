# Altera_FPGA_Projects  

This repository contains demo projects for those who are interested in getting started with FPGA development.  
The EP4CE6E22C8N FPGA board is a major requirement for running and testing the projects in this repository.  
All the projects in this repository strictly follow the Synchronous Design Methodology and are written in VHDL.
