# Interfacing an FPGA with an ILI9341 TFT module and HC06 Bluetooth Module        
## Description  
In this project, the FPGA decodes commands received from an HC06 Bluetooth module to determine the colour  
that should be displayed on the ILI9341 module. There are four colours that can be displayed on the TFT  
screen. These are: red, green, blue, and white.   
- When ``R`` or ``r`` is received, the screen will be filled with red.    
- When ``G`` or ``g`` is received, the screen will be filled with green.   
- When ``B`` or ``b`` is received, the screen will be filled with blue.   
- When characters other than the aforementioned ones are received, the screen will be filled with white.   

Unlike Project 10, this design uses a RAM-based Synchronous FIFO buffer to ensure that data isn't lost whenever the ``UART RX`` module transmits data faster than the ``SPI TX`` module can receive and decode.
  
The FIFO consists of two parts:  
1. The memory section (RAM)   
2. The controller (address and status signal generator)  

The ``Intel Quartus Prime User Guide: Design Recommendations`` was referenced in order to correctly infer a RAM.   
The ``Single-Clock, Simple Dual-Port Synchronous RAM with Old Data Read-During-Write Behaviour`` was inferred.    

System specs:     
- Main clock: 50 MHz       
- PLL clock: 5 MHz (drives all modules in the design)  
- SPI clock: PLL clock / 2        
- UART baud rate: 9600  
- FIFO address width: 6 (bits)  
- FIFO data width: 2 (bits)

## Building the project from a TCL script  
Ensure you're in the ``EP4CE6_Projects/P11_ILI9341_HC06_FIFO/`` directory before running the commands below.  
```
1. mkdir build  
2. cd build
3. quartus_sh -t ../rgb_display.tcl
4. quartus rgb_display.qpf
```

## What to do when Quartus opens    
- After Quartus opens, click on the ``Processing`` tab  
- Click on ``Start Compilation``  
- After compilation, click on ``Program Device(Open Programmer)``  
- When the Programmer window opens, load the demo project into the FPGA by clicking ``Start``

## Project file structure     
- The VHDL design files are located in the ``src`` and ``lib`` directories  
- The top-level design is the ``rgb_display.vhd``  
- The other modules or design files are located in the ``lib`` directory
- Testbenches are located in the ``simulation/testbench`` directory
- Test vectors for each module in the design can be found in the ``simulation/file/`` directory
- Test vectors are generated using the python script in each ``simulation/file/`` directory  

## Pinouts

## Decoding SPI (ILI9341) and UART (HC06) with a Logic Analyzer        
### 1. Configuring the registers of the ILI9341 using data/command sent via SPI from the FPGA

### 2. FPGA receives UART command (``R``) and sends pixel data (Red) to the ILI9341 via SPI

## Simulating the project with Modelsim  
Ensure you're in the ``EP4CE6_Projects/P11_ILI9341_HC06_FIFO/simulation/`` directory before proceeding to the next steps.  
The ``.do`` macro files are scripts that contain commands ModelSim uses to compile design files and testbenches. These scripts automate the simulation process by preventing the need to open the ModelSim GUI. For projects with multiple ``.do`` files, the process of executing one script is applicable to the rest. Therefore, the simulation procedure for one script is shown below.  

Procedure for the ``ram.do`` script (Same for the other scripts).  
```
mkdir build
cd build
vsim -c -do "do ../ram.do; quit"
```
Do not panic if the following output shows up on the command line: ``# ** Failure: Simulation done``. This is a VHDL quirk. However, you need to ensure no test fails. Simulation results can be found in the ``status_reports.txt`` files generated by the Python scripts invoked by ModelSim. Refer to the tree diagram in the [Project file structure](#project-file-structure) section of this README document.   

You need to create an environment variable to store the Quartus installation root in order to avoid the following error: "ERROR: quartus_root not set and MY_QUARTUS_PATH environment variable not found." The steps required to achieve this are explained below.  

For Linux (Ubuntu) users:  
Open the `.bashrc` file and add the following lines.   
```
export MY_QUARTUS_PATH="/opt/intelFPGA_lite/20.1/quartus"
export PATH="$MY_QUARTUS_PATH/bin:$PATH"
```
Run `source ~/.bashrc` and restart your terminal.
