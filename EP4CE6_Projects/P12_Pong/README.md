## Description    
[To be added]  

## Tools  
- EP4CE6E22C8N Cyclone IV FPGA development board
- VGA monitor (640 x 480)  
- VGA cable  
- Intel Quartus Prime 20.1  

## How to use  
- Clone the ``Altera_FPGA_Projects`` repository  
- Open the ``EP4CE6_Projects/P12_Pong/VHDL/`` directory  
- Open the ``pong_main.qpf`` project file  
- Intel Quartus Prime should open after the previous step  
- After Quartus opens, click on the ``Processing`` tab  
- Click on ``Start Compilation``  
- After compilation, click on ``Program Device(Open Programmer)``  
- When the Programmer window opens, load the demo project into the FPGA by clicking ``Start`` 

## Project file structure  
- The **VHDL** design files are located in the **src** and **lib** directories  
- The top-level design is the **vga_main.vhd**  
- The other modules or design files are located in the **lib** directory  
- The **mif** directory contains the ``Memory Initialization Files (.mif)`` generated by MATLAB  

## Pinouts  
- Check the **Location** column in the image below for the pin mappings used in this project.

## Dual-purpose pins  
Some pins on the Altera EP4CE6 FPGA are dual-purpose i.e. they can be used as regular I/O pins or as programming pins.  
By default, pin 101 (also known as ``nCEO``) is a programming pin. It is routed to the digital-to-analog converter whose  
output feeds the ``Hysnc`` line of the VGA port. This means that we can't use pin 101 unless we set it as a normal I/O pin.  
The images below illustrate how to achieve this.  
### 1. Click on the ``Assignments`` then ``Device``

### 2. Click on ``Device and Pin Options``

### 3. Click on ``Dual-Purpose Pins`` and set ``nCEO`` as ``Use as regular I/O``
