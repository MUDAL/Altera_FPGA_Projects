# Python Scripts to generate Font ROMs for the VGA display    

## How to use  
In this example, the character **7** is drawn and the VHDL Font ROM code for it is generated.  

### The following steps apply to the two Python scripts    
1. Open the Python file with the Python IDLE.  
2. Click on ``Run Module`` to launch the Python Shell and TKinter graphical interface.
