# Interfacing an FPGA with a VGA monitor 

## Description    
- Displaying a 398 x 438 binary (bitmap) image on a VGA monitor using an FPGA.  
- The design and development processes involve VHDL and MATLAB.  
- MATLAB is used for the following:   
		1. Converting a grayscale image to a binary image using the thresholding algorithm  
		2. Writing the binary image or bitmap into a file (Memory Initialization File)  
- The Memory Initialization File (.mif) is required to load the bitmap into a frame buffer  
or bitmap memory in the VHDL design at compilation time.
- The 398 x 438 binary image is displayed on a 640 x 480 VGA monitor such that the spaces that are not
covered by the image are displayed in blue.

## Tools  
- EP4CE6E22C8N Cyclone IV FPGA development board
- VGA monitor (640 x 480)  
- VGA cable  
- Intel Quartus Prime 20.1  

## How to use  
- Clone the ``Altera_FPGA_Projects`` repository  
- Open the the ``EP4CE6_Projects/P6_VGA_1/VHDL/`` directory  
- Open the ``vga_main.qpf`` project file  
- Intel Quartus Prime should open after the previous step  
- After Quartus opens, click on the ``Processing`` tab  
- Click on ``Start Compilation``  
- After compilation, click on ``Program Device(Open Programmer)``  
- When the Programmer window opens, load the demo project into the FPGA by clicking ``Start`` 

## Project file structure  
- The **VHDL** design files are located in the **src** and **lib** directories  
- The top-level design is the **vga_main.vhd**  
- The other modules or design files are located in the **lib** directory  
- The **mif** directory contains the ``Memory Initialization File (.mif)`` generated by MATLAB  

## Pinouts  
- Check the **Location** column in the image below for the pin mappings used in this project.
